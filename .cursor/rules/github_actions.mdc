GitHub Actions doesnâ€™t provide a default personal access token (PAT). Instead, it creates a built-in token called `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` for each workflow run. This token is provided by github, and ends with the job or after 24 hrs, and the scope is limited to the current repository.

Use this in writing Github actions, unless you absolutely need some special privilages. (In which case set some minimal permission `secrets.GH_PAT`)
