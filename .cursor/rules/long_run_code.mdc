This pattern should apply for all long-running code.

Unbundle run() into:

- init() 
- continue(id)
- cleanup(id)

Never assume you will call these in order.

Always checkpoint and resume from id's. 

Pass nothing else.

This forces you to keep things serializable and therefore loggable, reproducible, parallelizable.

by the way try not to name them 'id' if you can add extra detail like 'runId', 'taskId', 'subTask2Id'.

Any time you cross a system boundary*:

RATE LIMITS, TIMEOUTS, RETRIES, LOG TRACE.

NO EXCEPTIONS.

*eg call microservice or external api. yes, this includes llm APIs, meaning every ai project needs this

DO NOT DO ANY OUTPUT FORMATTING UNTIL THE END

"its so easy to fstring/template string"

DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD

keep things in structured format all the way basically until the point of reading

debugging output formatting its own form of hell
