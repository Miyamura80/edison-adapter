# Agent Instructions

Before running the project, you need to set the required environment variables. These are defined in `global_config/global_config.py`.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the environment variables defined in `global_config.py`. You can find the required keys in the `REQUIRED_ENV_VARS` list within the `Config` class.
