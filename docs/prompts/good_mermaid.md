# Good Mermaid Diagram Principles


## 1: Group/Cluster relevant nodes together


## 2: Seperation of functionaltiy/roles by different node shapes/colors

Use different node shapes/colors to indicate different functionality/roles. For example, if you are modelling a human-computer interaction, you can use a different shape for the human node and the computer node.

Or, if you are modelling a process, you can use a different shape for the start node and the end node. You may also use a different shape for the decision/process node.


- Make sure the text is easy to read in terms of color. For example, if you are using dark colors, make sure the text is white/lighter color, and vice versa.



## 3: Good Alignment

Align items neatly for better readability.


## Other Considerations

- The text in each node should be concise and to the point, to prevent text overflow and clutter.
