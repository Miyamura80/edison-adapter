Use a monochrome palette dominated by black ink on a textured white background, with subtle gradients achieved through water dilution. Incorporate negative space thoughtfully to emphasize simplicity and harmony. Include natural elements such as bamboo, cherry blossoms, or mountains, temples, etc. depicted with minimal yet expressive lines, evoking a sense of tranquility and Zen. Avoid unnecessary details, focusing instead on evoking emotion through subtle contrasts and the beauty of imperfection."

Use professional photography composition with the banner as the main focal point. Make sure the text is large, highly readable (good color contrast with background) and the banner is visually appealing with good contrast. Remember, the banner text should take up majority of the image. You should zoom into the image as much as possible. \n\n {style_prompt}"
